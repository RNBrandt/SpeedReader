This project is designed to be a Ruby and Jquery based speed reading app.  It was originally conceived as a passion project in phase 2 of DBC.  Please feel free to look at and comment on any of the code.
# Tests left to write
3) click start reading button
  a) Is there a text well
  b) is there a number box
  c) is there a number slider (should not be)
  d) Is there a resume button
  e) is there a stop button
  f) is there a start reading button (there shouldn't be)
  g) HARD ONE after a certain amount of time is the appropriate word from the array present.
4) Click resume
  after a certain amount of time... is a different word in the text well.
5) Click stop
  a) all the tests from the splash page should pass again.

#Ways to make it better using React
1) update the dom with only the word that should be there
2) allow for dynamic speed changes
3) allow to back-up a few words
